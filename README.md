This is a project to develop a smart system


------------------------------------------------------------
The requirements for our system are as follows:

A 
- The tank must accelerate and decelerate 
- The tank must have autonomous driving capabilities
- The tank must be capable of braking
- The tank should turn 
- The hull should withstand collisions with objects
- The battery must be strong enough to power the components
- The tank should be able to be controlled manually using a controller. 


B 
- The tank can have suspension
- The tank must shoot pellets
- The turret should be capable of aiming along the X axis aiming
- The system can target a person or object and follow said target


C
- The turret can be capable of Y axis aiming 
- Aesthetics of the tank to make it more realistic
- Solar panels for recharging
- A Winch for towing purposes or in case it gets stuck
- Patrol mode (Guard a certain area: Doorway)



Specifications (Subject to change):

-  Tank can drive at 4 km/h
-  Tank can shoot projectiles upto 3 m
-  Tank can detect objects around it upto 30 cm
-  The tank can drive up an incline of 30 degrees
-  The tank shall have a transmitting/receiving range of 25 m
-  Tank must be able to turn 360 degrees while holding position. 
-  Tank must weight under 2.5 kg
-  Turret should be able to turn 90 degrees in each direction
-  Projectile should be accurate within 2 m (Â±10 cm)

I have achieved many of this requirements in this project but  some are still not achieved and I'm continuously working to achieve the rest of the requirements that I haven't achieved yet.
